## Deploy notes

<!-- Anything the deploy needs:
     - new env var? (added to Infisical + Dockerfile + workflow build-args?)
     - migration with backfill or downtime?
     - first-deploy ordering constraint?
     Otherwise write "none". -->

- [ ] New env vars added to Infisical at `https://secrets.serendepify.com`
- [ ] DB migration safe to run with traffic
- [ ] No new `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars OR they're plumbed through `Dockerfile` + `deploy.yml`
